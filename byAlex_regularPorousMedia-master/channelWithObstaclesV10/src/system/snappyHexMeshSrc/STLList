// Can work in three modes:
// - follow : makes sure each processor has all the triangles inside the
// externally provided bounding box (usually the mesh bounding box).
// Guarantees minimum amount of communication since mesh-local queries
// should be answerable without any comms.
// - independent : surface is decomposed according to the triangle centres
// so the decomposition might be radically different from the mesh
// decomposition. Guarantees best memory balance but at the expense of
// more communication.
// - frozen : no change
